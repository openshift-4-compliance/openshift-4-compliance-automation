# Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management Policies
Policies in this folder are based on [Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.2/). The policies in this folder are based on security controls from the [OCP 4.x Platform &Infrastructure Security Best Practices](https://github.com/rhilconsultants/openshift/blob/master/featureReference/Red%20Hat%20Openshift%204.x%20Security%20Best%20Practices%20-%20Public%20Edition%20-%20Final%20v2%20(2).pdf) compliance document. Each security control will be represented by its own directory.

The solution presented in this directory is designed to provide compliance accross a multi cluster [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) environment. Note that some policies can be applied _out of the box_, while other policies may require changes according to organization regulations.

## Applying Policies
The policies can be applied to the Advanced Cluster Management hub cluster. By default all policies take effect on all managed clusters with the `environment=dev` label. To apply a policy from the collection, run the next command -

```
<hub cluster> $ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelkotelnikov/openshift-4-compliance-automation/master/redhat-acm/authorization/disallowed-role-policy.yml
```
