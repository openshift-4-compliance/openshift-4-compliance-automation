# Gatekeeper OAuth Secured Identity Providers Only

The policy ensures that only secured identityProviders (based on a dynamic, customizable list) are allowed in the cluster.
The policy uses the next [Gatekeeper policy](../../../open-policy-agent/authentication-user-management/oauth-secured-identity-providers-only/) in order to function.
