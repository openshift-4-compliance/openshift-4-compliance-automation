# Kyverno Policies
Policies in this folder are based on [Kyverno - Kubernetes Native Policy Management](https://kyverno.io/docs/introduction/). The policies in this folder are based on security controls from the [OCP 4.x Platform &Infrastructure Security Best Practices](https://github.com/rhilconsultants/openshift/blob/master/featureReference/Red%20Hat%20Openshift%204.x%20Security%20Best%20Practices%20-%20Public%20Edition%20-%20Final%20v2%20(2).pdf) compliance document. Each security control will be represented by its own directory.

The solution presented in this directory is designed to provide compliance for  [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) clusters. Note that some policies can be applied _out of the box_, while other policies may require changes according to organization regulations.

### Authorization
Policy  | Description | Prerequisites
------- | ----------- | -------------
[protect-default-scc](./authorization/protect-default-scc.yaml) | Ensures that default scc are not being modified or deleted |
[disallow-scc-runasany](./authorization/disallow-scc-runasany.yaml) | Ensures that SCC Strategies used in custom created scc are not permissive. **This policy excludes default scc policies, it is highly recommended to apply 'protect-default-scc' |

[disallow-host-ports](authorization/host-namespaces/disallow-host-ports.yaml) | Ensures that access to the host ports is restricted in PODs that are not OpenShift System PODs, and prevent custom SCCs to allow host ports access |
[disallow-host-network](authorization/host-namespaces/disallow-host-network.yaml) | Ensures that access to the host network namespaces is restricted in PODs that are not OpenShift System PODs, and prevent custom SCCs to allow host network access |
[disallow-host-pid](authorization/host-namespaces/disallow-host-pid.yaml) | Ensures that access to the host PID namespaces is restricted in PODs that are not OpenShift System PODs, and prevent custom SCCs to allow host PID access |
[disallow-host-ipc](authorization/host-namespaces/disallow-host-ipc.yaml) | Ensures that access to the host IPC namespaces is restricted in PODs that are not OpenShift System PODs, and prevent custom SCCs to allow host IPC access |

## Applying Policies
The policies can be created by applying the custom resources defined in the cluster policy 'yaml' files to an OpenShift cluster. The files are provided in each policy directory under specific security control.

For example, applying 'protect-default-scc' policy which prevents from default OpenShift scc to be modified or deleted by users

```
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-4-compliance/openshift-4-compliance-automation/master/kyverno/authentication-user-management/protect-default-scc.yaml
```
