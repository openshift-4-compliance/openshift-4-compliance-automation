# Kyverno Policies
Policies in this folder are based on [Kyverno - Kubernetes Native Policy Management](https://kyverno.io/docs/introduction/). The policies in this folder are based on security controls from the [OCP 4.x Platform &Infrastructure Security Best Practices](https://github.com/rhilconsultants/openshift/blob/master/featureReference/Red%20Hat%20Openshift%204.x%20Security%20Best%20Practices%20-%20Public%20Edition%20-%20Final%20v2%20(2).pdf) compliance document. Each security control will be represented by its own directory.

The solution presented in this directory is designed to provide compliance for  [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) clusters. Note that some policies can be applied _out of the box_, while other policies may require changes according to organization regulations.

## Applying Policies
The policies can be created by applying the custom resources defined in the cluster policy 'yaml' files to an OpenShift cluster. The files are provided in each policy directory under specific security control.

For example, applying 'protect-default-scc' policy which prevents from default OpenShift scc to be modified or deleted by users

```
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-4-compliance/openshift-4-compliance-automation/master/kyverno/authentication-user-management/protect-default-scc.yaml
```
