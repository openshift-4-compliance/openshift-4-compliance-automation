# Kyverno Policies
Policies in this folder are based on [Kyverno - Kubernetes Native Policy Management](https://kyverno.io/docs/introduction/). The policies in this folder are based on security controls from the [OCP 4.x Platform &Infrastructure Security Best Practices](https://github.com/rhilconsultants/openshift/blob/master/featureReference/Red%20Hat%20Openshift%204.x%20Security%20Best%20Practices%20-%20Public%20Edition%20-%20Final%20v2%20(2).pdf) compliance document. Each security control will be represented by its own directory.

The solution presented in this directory is designed to provide compliance for  [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) clusters. Note that some policies can be applied _out of the box_, while other policies may require changes according to organization regulations.
