# OPA Gatekeeper Policies
Policies in this folder are based on [OPA Gatekeeper for Kubernetes](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/kubernetes-introduction/). The policies in this folder are based on security controls from the [OCP 4.x Platform &Infrastructure Security Best Practices](https://github.com/rhilconsultants/openshift/blob/master/featureReference/Red%20Hat%20Openshift%204.x%20Security%20Best%20Practices%20-%20Public%20Edition%20-%20Final%20v2%20(2).pdf) compliance document. Each security control will be represented by its own directory.

The solution presented in this directory is designed to provide compliance for  [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) clusters. Note that some policies can be applied _out of the box_, while other policies may require changes according to organization regulations.

### Trusted Image Sources
Policy  | Description | Prerequisites

[disallowed-registries](./trusted-image-sources/disallowedtagsdisallowed-registries) | Requires setting up allowed image sources (registries). Any other image source is disallowed. |

## Applying Policies
The policies can be created by applying the custom resources defined in the `template.yaml` and `contraint.yaml` files to an OpenShift cluster. The files are provided in each policy directory under specific security control.

For example, applying 'kubeadmin' temporary user removal validation policy

```
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-4-compliance/openshift-4-compliance-automation/master/open-policy-agent/authentication-user-management/delete-kubeadmin/template.yaml
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-4-compliance/openshift-4-compliance-automation/master/open-policy-agent/authentication-user-management/delete-kubeadmin/constraint.yaml
```

## Applying policies using GitOps
You can use the `dryrun` enforcement mode in either all policies or in policy groups.
You can use the `deny` enforcement mode in either all policies, in policy groups, or individually.


You can't include specific policies in `dryrun` enforcement mode, you can use the alternative workflow suggested at the end of the paragraph in [this link](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/faq/kustomize/eschewedfeatures/#removal-directives).
